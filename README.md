## Challenges Faced üòµ:

<strong>I faced several technical challenges while developing the HR Analytics Dashboard, which put my problem-solving abilities and creativity to the test. Here are the main obstacles and how I tackled them:</strong>

1. **Creating Donut Charts**: Tableau doesn't inherently support donut charts, which posed an interesting challenge. To solve it, I first created duplicate pie charts. Then, I modified the duplicated pie charts to transform them into empty, gray circles by removing their data and matching the color to the dashboard‚Äôs background. By superimposing these empty charts over the original pie charts, I successfully crafted the donut charts that added a visually appealing element to the dashboard.

2. **Developing Age Bin Charts**: Configuring the age bin chart was particularly challenging due to the need to accurately represent various age groups without oversimplifying. I experimented with several bin sizes and intervals until I found a configuration that captured the essential trends and distributions effectively.

## Data Insights and Visualizations üìä:

### Attrition Rate by Business Travel
Bar chart displaying attrition rates categorized by frequency of business travel.

### Employee Distribution by Age Group

### Job Satisfaction Rating

### Department-Wise Attrition

### Attrition Rate by Gender and Age Group

## Quantitative Key Findings üîç:

| Metric                            | Value         | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Employees**               | 1,470         | Total number of employees analyzed.                  |

| **Active Employees**              | 1,233         | Number of active employees.                          |
| **Average Age**                   | 37            | Average age of employees.                            |


## Conclusion and Insights üí°:

Based on the analysis, here are strategic recommendations to improve employee retention and organizational effectiveness:

1. **Tailored Retention Programs**: Develop targeted retention initiatives for high-risk groups identified during the analysis, such as employees who travel frequently for business. Providing personalized support and incentives can help to reduce attrition in these segments.

2. **Career Development Opportunities**: Enhance career development pathways and training programs, particularly for younger employees aged 25-34, who display a higher attrition rate. Investing in their professional growth and skill development can increase loyalty and commitment.

3. **Departmental Engagement Strategies**: Implement department-specific engagement strategies to address attrition disparities across organizational units. For example, focusing on improving job satisfaction and work-life balance in departments with high attrition rates, such as sales and R&D, could result in significant retention gains.
